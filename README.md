## Conversation API - Python

This is a remake of an API originally created in Ruby. It's not too complex so thought it would be a good opportunity to learn some Python.
The purpose of this API is to provide a clone of WhatsApp with groups of messages between users. These messages will be displayed through a frontend built using React. At the moment there are two different groups of messages the API needs to be able to return, all messages between two users and a users most recent message for each of their conversations.

This project is using Flask, Postgresql with SQLAlchemy.

## How it Works

The API utilises the SQLAlchemy ORM to create three models inside a Postgresql database. 
 * Message
 * Conversation
 * ConversationUserJoin

A Separate Ruby API exists to handle user models, using a different database, therefore the join table has to be manually created and maintained.

Users sign in on the front end React app, the app sends a GET request to the python API for the most recent conversations the current user is in. The app also GET requests the messages for the most recent conversation the user had. Users can then send POST requests to create new messages.

#### Conversation Controller

There are three routes:
 * GET messages from a conversation
 * GET users most recent message for all conversations
 * POST new message in conversation

Messages are sent with 'receiver_ids' and a 'sender_id', these are used to find which conversation to attribute the message to.

#### Conversation Service

The method written to find a conversation between a group of users became a bit complex to imagine using the ORM tool so it was written in SQL. Hopefully this will be converted into methods on the ORM. The SQL query is made up of three select statements each querying a table returned by the last, returned is either a conversation id for the conversation between a group of users, or nothing. If no conversation id is returned, a conversation is created and the user ids of those involved are stored in the join table.

## Running the API

Here is the series of commands to download and run the app, explanations for each step follow.

```shell
~ git clone https://github.com/Mallig/conversations-python.git
~ cd conversations-python
~ mkdir instance
~ touch instance/config.py
~ createdb conversation_python
~ echo "SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI='postgresql://localhost:5432/conversation_python'" >> instance/config.py
~ python3 -m venv venv
~ source venv/bin/activate
~ pip install -r requirements.txt
~ export FLASK_APP=api
~ export FLASK_ENV=development
~ flask run
```

Python can be installed with

```shell
~ brew install python
```

This will also install pip - the python package installer, and venv - environment manager for python projects.

Assuming you have Postgresql installed, create the database which you would like the api to connect to. Create a directory named 'instance' on the project root, and inside create a file named 'config.py'. This is where you configure python environment variables. The only one needed to run the app is the database uri

```python
# instance/config.py

SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI='<postgresql database uri>'
```

Postgresql database URIs come in the format `postgresql://[user[:password]@][netloc][:port][/dbname][?param1=value1&...]`, where dbname is the database you created earlier.

Create a virtual environment in which to manage app dependencies, `cd` to the project directory and run

```shell
~ python3 -m venv <venv_name>
```

This will create a directory on the project root by the name you choose, containing a key pointing to the Python installation used in the command along with scripts (in bin/) and site packages.

Enter the virtual environment

```shell
~ source <venv_name>/bin/activate
``` 
 
(run `~ deactivate` to exit venv)

To install the dependencies to a virtual environment just for this project run 

```shell
~ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Nearly there, all you need to do now is tell Flask where to find the application and the environment

```shell
~ export FLASK_APP=api
~ export FLASK_ENV=development
```

And you're done! Run the application

```shell
flask run
```

Easy peasy.

Now you can make requests to the app however you please, the following commands were written to hit each route using httpie:
 - `~ http GET :5000/conversation/1/latest`
 - `~ http GET :5000/conversation/1/id`
 - `~ http POST :5000/messages sender_id=1 content='hello from httpie' receiver_ids:='[2]'`

Run `~ deactivate` to exit the venv, when starting up the app again you must activate the venv and set the flask environment variables again

```shell
~ source <venv_name>/bin/activate
~ export FLASK_APP=api
~ export FLASK_ENV=development
~ flask run
```

## Running Tests

Tests are written using pytest with help from pytest-flask, and coverage from pytest-cov. Make sure the virtual environment has been activated then run the tests with:

```shell
~ python -m pytest --cov=api test/
```

add the flag `-v` or `-vv` from more detail

Tests achieve 100% coverage through integration tests, 74% through unit tests as the conversation controller is not yet tested.
