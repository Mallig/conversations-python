## Conversations API - Python

This is a remake of an API originally created in Ruby. It's not too complex so thought it would be a good opportunity to learn some python.
The purpose of this API is to provide a clone of WhatsApp with groups of messages between users. These messages will be displayed through a frontend built using React. At the moment there are two different groups of messages the api needs to be able to return, all messages between two users and the most recent message between a user and all other users they have been in contact with.

This project is using Flask, Postgresql with SQLAlchemy.

## Running the API

Python can be installed with

`~ brew install python`

This will also install pip - the python package installer, and venv - package manager for python projects.

If you want to create a virtual environment in which to manage app dependencies `cd` to the project directory and run

`~ python3 -m venv .`

To enter the virtual environment run

`~ source bin/activate` 
 
(run `~ deactivate` to exit venv)

To install the dependencies to a virtual environment just for this project run 

`~ pip install -r requirements.txt`
